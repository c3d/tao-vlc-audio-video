 * Play audio and video content using the VideoLAN (VLC) player.
 *
 * The primitives documented in this page provide audio and video
 * playback capabilities. You can use them to add music and videos
 * to your presentations. Thanks to the rich format and codec support
 * of libVLC, most common audio and video formats are
 * supported on all platformas (Windows, MacOSX, Linux).
 *
 * One multimedia stream is associated with each call to movie or
 * movie_texture. It is possible to play several audio or video
 * files simultaneously. The following examples shows how you can control
 * the playback through a common function, @c play.
 *
 * @code
play T:text ->
    color "white"
    movie_texture T

    play "first.mpeg"
    rounded_rectangle 0, 0, 352, 240, 20

page "Second video",
    play "second.mpeg"

 * Plays a video.

 * @p sy to 1.0 to keep the original resolution.
 * The @p name parameter specifies a local file or a URL; an empty string
