This is the VLCAudioVideo module for Tao Presentations 1.0.
Supported platforms: Windows x86 (MinGW), MacOSX x86, Linux x86.

To build this module, you need the following:

1. Tao Presentations 1.0-beta10 or later, available
from from http://taodyne.com/.
2. The Qt SDK, available from http://qt.nokia.com/.
3. The VLC SDK version 1.2 (1.1.x will NOT work). Pre-release
builds are available from http://nightlies.videolan.org/.
Extract the tarball. 

Build steps:

1. Open the Tao Presentation installation folder and locate the 'sdk' folder.
2. Copy 'sdk' to a safe place, for instance your home directory.
3. Clone this project into sdk/modules/vlc_audio_video.
4. cd sdk/modules
5. ./configure  # Will tell where it expects to find the VLC SDK
6. cd vlc_audio_video
7. make install

The new module will be installed in a user-specific location and will take
precedence on the default VLCAudioVideo module when Tao Presentation needs it.
'make install' will not overwrite any file installed with the application.
See sdk/modules/README_SDK for details.
