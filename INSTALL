Build instructions for the VLCAudioVideo module for Tao Presentations 1.0.
Supported platforms: Windows (x86) (MinGW), MacOSX (x86, x86_64),
Linux (x86, x86_64).

To build this module, you need the following:

1. Tao Presentations, available from http://taodyne.com/.
2. The VLC media player, available from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.
   On Windows, you need the 7zip package, because the SDK is not distributed
   with the Installer (Exe) or the Zip package :(.
3. The Qt SDK, available from http://qt-project.org/downloads.
4. On Windows, you also need the MinGW/MSYS build environment. Get it from
   http://www.mingw.org/.

Build steps:

1. Open the Tao Presentation installation folder and locate the 'sdk' folder.
2. Copy the 'sdk' folder to a safe place, for instance your home directory.
   On Windows, you should extract the VLC .7z archive next to the 'sdk' folder
   and rename it 'VLC', so that it will be found automatically.
3. Clone this project into sdk/modules/vlc_audio_video:
   $ cd sdk/modules
   $ git clone git://gitorious.org/tao-presentation-modules/vlc_audio_video.git
4. Run the configure script (from the 'modules' directory).
   $ ./configure
5. Build and install the VLCAudioVideo module:
   $ make install

The new module will be copied into a user-specific location and will take
precedence on the default VLCAudioVideo module.
'make install' will not overwrite any file installed with Tao Presentations.
See sdk/modules/README_SDK for details.
