Build instructions for the VLCAudioVideo module for Tao Presentations 1.0.
Supported platforms: Windows (x86) (MinGW), MacOSX (x86, x86_64),
Linux (x86, x86_64).

To build this module, you need the following:

1. Tao Presentations 1.0-beta10 or later, available from http://taodyne.com/.
2. The VLC media player, available from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.
   On Windows, you need the Zip package, because some header files are not
   distributed with the Installer (Exe) package :(.
3. The Qt SDK, available from http://qt.nokia.com/.
4. On Windows, you also need the MinGW build environment.

Build steps:

1. Open the Tao Presentation installation folder and locate the 'sdk' folder.
2. Copy the 'sdk' folder to a safe place, for instance your home directory.
3. Clone this project into sdk/modules/vlc_audio_video:
   $ cd sdk/modules
   $ git clone git://gitorious.org/tao-presentation-modules/vlc_audio_video.git
4. Run the configure script (from the 'modules' directory).
   $ ./configure
5. Build and install the VLCAudioVideo module:
   $ make install

The new module will be copied into a user-specific location and will take
precedence on the default VLCAudioVideo module.
'make install' will not overwrite any file installed with Tao Presentations.
See sdk/modules/README_SDK for details.
