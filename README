This is the VLCAudioVideo module for Tao Presentations 1.40 or later.

Tao Presentation is a 3D presentation software for MacOSX, Windows and Linux.
It relies on OpenGL and on a dynamically compiled document description language
based on XLR, an Open Source project (http://xlr.sourceforge.net/).
The application is extensible through modules.

Tao Presentations may be downloaded from http://taodyne.com/.

VLCAudioVideo is a Tao Presentation module that can be used to play audio and
video inside a 3D document. The module uses the VLC engine (libVLC) to decode
and render the videos, which makes it quite powerful. It can read many file
formats and even supports video streaming.

VLCAudioVideo is released under the GPLv2 licence (see COPYING). Build
instructions are in INSTALL.
